/// scene into a RenderQueueUVE (via IMeshRendererUVE), lazily uploads each encountered mesh's/
/// material's GPU-shaped resources (cached, invalidated on hot-reload), and records the resulting
/// draw calls into a real ICommandBufferUVE submitted through IRenderSystemUVE. Renders into an
/// internally-owned offscreen color+depth target only — no WindowManagerUVE/swapchain exists yet
/// in this sandbox (no display server, GPU device node, or graphics SDK headers), so there is no
/// present step. Adding one later is additive, not a redesign.

/// engine thread only, after SceneGraphUVE::UpdateUVE() has run for this frame (it needs current
/// WorldTransformComponentUVE data), matching EngineCoreUVE's single-threaded Update -> Render
